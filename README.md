# FedlEarn

## Overview  
FedlEarn is a Python-based implementation of a federated learning workflow. Clients train local models on their data, the server aggregates parameters, and finally the global model can be reconstructed from the aggregated weights.

## Features  
- Multiple client scripts (`client.py`) that train on separate datasets (e.g., `client11.csv`, `client21.csv`, …)  
- A server script (`server.py`) that collects model updates from clients and performs parameter aggregation.  
- Model checkpoint files (`model_upto1.npz`, `model_upto2.npz`, `model_upto3.npz`) that store the evolving global model parameters.  
- Reconstruction of the global model via `remodel2.py` (and similarly `remodel1.py`, `remodel3.py`).  
- A simple UI script (`ui3.py`) for interacting with or visualizing results.  
- A `run.sh` shell script to orchestrate the workflow end-to-end.

Getting Started 🚀
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Required Python packages (you may install them via pip install …).

Ensure all client CSV files are available in the Dataset/ folder as listed (e.g., client11.csv, client21.csv, …)

The dataset combined1.csv should be generated (or already present) containing merged data from all clients.

A test dataset test.csv should be present.

Installation & Usage
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Shreyas277/FedlEarn.git
cd FedlEarn
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # on Unix/macOS
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt # (if you add one)
Run the workflow:

Bash

./run.sh
This script will:

Trigger client side training for each dataset

Aggregate the results on the server side

Save model checkpoint files (model_upto1.npz, etc)

Reconstruct the global model from checkpoints via remodel*.py

Optionally launch the UI (ui3.py) for visualization.

Configuration ⚙️
You may edit client.py & server.py to change model hyperparameters, number of clients, dataset paths, or aggregation logic.

The checkpoint files are named model_uptoX.npz where X indicates up to which client’s updates were included. Adjust naming/logic as needed.

How It Works (Conceptually) 🧠
Client Side: Each client loads its local data CSV (e.g., client11.csv) and trains a local model. It then exports its model weights (e.g., via numpy) and sends them to the server.

Server Side: The server collects the weights from all clients, performs an aggregation step (e.g., averaging) to form a new global model weight set. This is saved as model_upto1.npz, model_upto2.npz, etc.

Reconstruction / Deployment: Scripts such as remodel2.py load the checkpoint file and build an ANN model that uses those weights for inference or further training.

Visualization / UI: The ui3.py script offers a simple interface (CLI or GUI) to inspect results, maybe show accuracy on test.csv, visualize model behaviour, etc.
